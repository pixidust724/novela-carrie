Hong Kong a city that holds over 7 million inhabitants, being recognized as the fourth-most densely populated region in the world. A solid, optimize and smooth health care system is very important to such a dense and busy city. 

The project community nurse is a platform to connect all the community nurses in the city and respond to patient's newly created cases.
