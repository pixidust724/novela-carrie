excerpt: This is my first time experience in machine learning. I have attended the course of Intelligent Systems - “Machine Learning Competition” Seminar in University of Siegen. Here in this post I will present my achievement for first individual challenge and second a group work challenge

In the practical course, two data sets were given to us. Our task was to train several machine learning models that can predict the interest rate in the data sets, achieved in a high accuracy. The two tasks included both a regression and a classification problem and, due to the large amount of data, placed high demands on the skills of data pre-processing and feature se-lection. The models were then tested against a given test set at an online data science platform Kaggle. In there students among our class are competed against each other in terms of best model performance. 

The course included both individual, followed by a group work and concluded with a final presen-tation on the results achieved. 

In the future, I am planning to participate more Kaggle challenge. You can find me [HERE](https://www.kaggle.com/laukaheicarrie) .
