bio: |
  I am passionate about design, as well as diving and reading. 
  I appreciate designs that can solve problems and influence human behaviours. 
  In the past, I had focused in projects that were related to Human-Computer Interaction. 
  In recent years, I have challenged myself to get my hands dirty in coding, deep learning and topics that are related to ubiquitous computing.
