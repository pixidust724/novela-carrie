bio: |
  I am passionate about design, as much as I enjoy diving and reading. 
  I appreciate designs which can solve problems and influence human behaviours. I am a user-centred designer adopting the principles of UCD methodology from user research to define audiences and concept to execution to deliver the design or end product in Agile process. I am a highly motivated and ambitious individual who is adaptable to changes and makes the most of these in any field.
